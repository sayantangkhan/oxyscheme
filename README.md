## Oxyscheme

Oxyscheme is a compiler frontend to a reasonably large subset of [R5RS Scheme](https://schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/r5rs.pdf).
The current goal is for Oxyscheme to generate LLVM IR, as a well as machine code for a simple stack based VM. The compiler is not meant
to be fast or state-of-art, but merely educational.
