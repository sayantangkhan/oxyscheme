* Oxyscheme
Oxyscheme is a compiler (front-end?) for a reasonable subset of Scheme written in Rust. It's
meant to be educational, and not fast and state-of-art.

** Things to do
*** Features to implement/fix
- [ ] Lex tokens that don't necessarily end with delimiter
- [ ] Make nom combinators work with ~Token~ (or ~TokenStream~?)
- [X] Improve error message handling, by implementing ~Debug~ or ~Display~ trait for ~CompilerError~
- [X] Make lexer lenient enough to handle whitespace
- [X] Handle comment strings as well
*** Refactoring
- [ ] Use ~ref~ and ~ref mut~ wherever that's more idiomatic
- [X] Use ~if let~ and ~while let~ wherever applicable
- [X] Make clippy pedantic about everything
