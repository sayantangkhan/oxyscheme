* Oxyscheme
Oxyscheme is a compiler (front-end?) for a reasonable subset of scheme written in Rust. It's
meant to be educational, and not fast and state-of-art.

** Things to do
- [ ] Make lexer lenient enough to handle whitespace
- [ ] Lex tokens that don't necessarily end with delimiter
- [X] Use ~if let~ and ~while let~ wherever applicable
- [X] Make clippy pedantic about everything
